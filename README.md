ECOMM-STORE: High-Fidelity Vanilla JS Platform
A sophisticated, framework-less e-commerce engine engineered with Pure Vanilla JavaScript. This project showcases advanced DOM manipulation, state management, and custom UI architecture—built from the ground up without relying on React, Vue, or any external libraries.

Modern Design Language: A premium, responsive UI featuring glassmorphism effects, custom animations, and CSS-in-JS styling.

Technical Deep Dive
